// This test shows what shadowing of variable names can do. Especially
// the replacing of equation where tie LHS is a simple variable name.
//
// In my opinion, this is a very strange feature, which I'm not sure
// is a good idea at all.

// The equations should be
//
//   a.x == 2
//
// the x = 1 equation is shadowed by the modification.
